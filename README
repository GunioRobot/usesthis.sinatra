    The Setup is a Sinatra-based nerdy interviews web application, and lives
    at http://usesthis.com/. This is the source code, for better or worse.

    Ruby gems it uses:
    
    * Sinatra (duh)         http://www.sinatrarb.com/
    * HAML                  http://haml-lang.com/
    * DataMapper            http://datamapper.org/
    * RDiscount             http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount

    Love,
